### Application instructions (assuming Mac OS)
* If you want to use Postgres for the database and not to install Rail's testing tools, create a file called `.railsrc` in your home directory (using the text editor of your choice) and add the line `-d postgresql -T`

* Clone the repository and direct your terminal into the home repository folder `Computer:steves_sock_shack user$`

* Run `$ gem install rails`

* Verify that you are running ruby-2.4.1 in your terminal (bash and/or atom's terminal).

* Run `$ bundle install` to install Ruby gems packages related to the Gemfile in the top level.

* Rspec setup (Unit Testing and Models): In the terminal, run the following command `$ bundle exec rails generate rspec:install`. Files will be generated in the spec folder.  In the home repository folder run `$ rspec` to view tests passing or failing.

* Database setup...
* * Database setup: Run `rake db:migrate db:test:prepare` to prepare the database and create the Active Record schema.rb file, respectively.

* Rails server: Run `$ rails server` to start the Rails server.  Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.  Refresh the page to reload any changes to the source files.
